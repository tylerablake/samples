<h4>What is .NET MVC?</h4>
<p>ASP.NET is a free web framework for building great Web sites and Web applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>ASP.NET MVC gives you a powerful, patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns and gives you full control over markup for enjoyable, agile development.</p>


<h4>What is Entity Framework?</h4>
<p>Entity Framework (EF) is a ORM, Object-Relational Mapping framework that we will use to query the database, retrieve data, and map data into our classes which we then present to the user.</p>

<h4>SQL</h4>
<p>SQL (Structured Query Language), is what we will use to review and investigate possible issues with our database.</p>

<h4>Web Deploy</h4>
<p>Web Deploy is the method for deployment that we will use which consists of uploading a publish profile which auto fills our 1 click publish settings inside of Visual Studio.</p>

<h4>HTMl and CSS</h4>
<p>The UI will be comprised of HTML and CSS mostly, some JavaScript interaction will be used for interactions and some service calls though!</p>

<h4>Bootstrap</h4>
<p>Bootstrap is a web framework used to help make websites responsive by providing a set of rules that developers can use in their applications, most all applications on the internet use Bootstrap or some similar framework.</p>

<h4>JavaScript</h4>
<p>JavaScript (JS) is a web language that you can basically do anything with, even build full stack web applications with! For this project we'll rely on JS to debug on the client browser, make service calls, and make animations in the UI.</p>

<h4>Web Browser Developer Tools</h4>
<p>Web Broswer Developer Tools (Dev Tools) is what we will rely on to help debug server errors in the browser, these tools come built into most web browsers but I prefer Google and FireFox's dev tools.</p>


<p>Now that we've had a brief overview of some technologies that we'll use, let's start diving into them, we'll start with .NET MVC</p>
